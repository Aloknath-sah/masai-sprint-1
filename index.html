            Dexter's Laboratory (commonly abbreviated as Dexter's Lab) is an
            American animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky
            for
            <a href="page_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Cartoon Network</b></a
            >. It follows Dexter, a boy-genius and inventor with a hidden
            laboratory in his room, which he keeps secret from his parents. He
            is in a constant battle with his older sister Dee Dee, who always
            finds a way to get inside Dexter's lab and inadvertently foil his
            experiments.

            Dexter also engages in a bitter rivalry with a fellow boy-genius
            named Mandark, who is Dexter's neighbor and classmate. Prominently
            featured in the series' first two seasons are segments featuring
            superhero-based characters Monkey, Dexter's pet
            lab-monkey/superhero, and The Justice Friends, a trio of superheroes
            who share an apartment. Tartakovsky pitched the series to Fred
            Seibert's first animated shorts showcase What a Cartoon! at
            Hanna-Barbera, basing it on student films Tartakovsky produced at
            the California Institute of the Arts, and four pilots aired from
            1995 to 1996.

            Viewer approval ratings led to a half-hour series, which initially
            ran for two seasons with 52 total episodes from April 27, 1996, to
            June 15, 1998. On December 10, 1999, a made-for-television movie
            titled Ego Trip aired as the intended series finale, and Tartakovsky
            left to begin work on Samurai Jack. In 2001, the series was revived
            for two more seasons containing 26 total episodes, which began on
            November 18 of that year, and concluded on November 20, 2003. Due to
            Tartakovsky's departure from the series, the new seasons were made
            under Chris Savino and a different production team at
            <a href="page_1.html" target="_blank">Cartoon Network</a> Studios,
            with various changes to the visual art style and character designs.
