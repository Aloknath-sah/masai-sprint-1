          Dexter's Laboratory (commonly abbreviated as Dexter's Lab) is an
          American animated television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for
          <a href="page_1.html" target="_blank"><b>Cartoon Network</b></a
          >. It follows Dexter, a boy-genius and inventor with a hidden
          laboratory in his room, which he keeps secret from his parents. He is
          in a constant battle with his older sister Dee Dee, who always finds a
          way to get inside Dexter's lab and inadvertently foil his experiments.
          Dexter also engages in a bitter rivalry with a fellow boy-genius named
          Mandark, who is Dexter's neighbor and classmate. Prominently featured
          in the series' first two seasons are segments featuring
          superhero-based characters Monkey, Dexter's pet lab-monkey/superhero,
          and The Justice Friends, a trio of superheroes who share an apartment.
          Tartakovsky pitched the series to Fred Seibert's first animated shorts
          showcase What a Cartoon! at Hanna-Barbera, basing it on student films
          Tartakovsky produced at the California Institute of the Arts, and four
          pilots aired from 1995 to 1996. Viewer approval ratings led to a
          half-hour series, which initially ran for two seasons with 52 total
          episodes from April 27, 1996, to June 15, 1998. On December 10, 1999,
          a made-for-television movie titled Ego Trip aired as the intended
          series finale, and Tartakovsky left to begin work on Samurai Jack. In
          2001, the series was revived for two more seasons containing 26 total
          episodes, which began on November 18 of that year, and concluded on
          November 20, 2003. Due to Tartakovsky's departure from the series, the
          new seasons were made under Chris Savino and a different production
          team at
          <a href="page_1.html" target="_blank">Cartoon Network</a> Studios,
          with various changes to the visual art style and character designs.
