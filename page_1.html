            Cartoon Network is an American cable television channel owned by
            Warner Bros. Entertainment, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia. The
            channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts
            animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging
            from action to animated comedy. It operates usually from 6:00 AM to
            8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is targeted at children between ages 7 and 15.
            Its overnight daypart block Adult Swim is aimed at young adults and
            is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a
            separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes.[1] A Spanish
            language audio track for select programs is accessible via second
            audio programing (SAP); some TV providers offer the Spanish feed as
            a separate channel by removing the main English-language audio
            track.

            best friend and adoptive brother Jake John DiMaggio a dog with the
            magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live
