          Cartoon Network is an American cable television channel owned by
          Warner Bros. Entertainment, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia. The
          channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts
          animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging
          from action to animated comedy. It operates usually from 6:00 AM to
          8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is targeted at children between ages 7 and 15. Its
          overnight daypart block Adult Swim is aimed at young adults and is
          treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a
          separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes.[1] A Spanish
          language audio track for select programs is accessible via second
          audio programing (SAP); some TV providers offer the Spanish feed as a
          separate channel by removing the main English-language audio track.
