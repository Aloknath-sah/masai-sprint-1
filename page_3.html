          There is nothing more beautiful than the memories of childhood.
          Childhood is the most precious time in one’s life. The memories of
          childhood are either the fondest ones or the ones that are
          fictitiously dreadful. This is the best time for kids to learn and
          adapt the nature, the compassion towards other beings. Childhood plays
          an important role in one’s development and how we grow as people. It
          is the time to revel in the fun and enjoy to the maximum.

          Today is the age of internet where children stick to indoor activities
          and spend maximum time indoors. But outdoor activities are equally
          important to keep the mind healthy. Also, it has been scientifically
          proven that children learn more while playing. Playing outdoor games
          build confidence and physical strength. It opens their mind to use
          their creativity and imagination. It is while playing the outdoor
          games children interact with the world around them.

          I dreamt of my childhood home last night. Which is a funny thing to
          say when one actually had more than one childhood home. In fact, I
          lived in five different homes until the ripe age of 18 when I left my
          small town for the big city. But when I dream of my childhood home,
          it’s always the same one. The middle one where I lived from the age of
          about four to eleven (give or take a year). I bet my younger sisters
          do not have many memories of this home but it’s always where I go to
          when thinking of childhood.
